Due to the potential for serious harm associated with patient falls, “patient death or serious injury associated with a fall while being cared for in a health care setting” is considered a Serious Reportable Event by the National Quality Forum (NQF, 2019).\n\nFalls (including unplanned or unintended descents to the floor) can result in patient injury ranging from minor abrasion or bruising to death as a result of injuries sustained from a fall. While major injuries (e.g., fractures, closed head injuries, internal bleeding) (Mintz et al., 2022) have the biggest impact on patient outcomes, 2008-2021 data findings from The 2022 Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD) demonstrated that 41.8 % of falls resulted in moderate injuries such as skin tear, avulsion, hematoma, significant bruising, dislocations and lacerations requiring suturing (NPSD, 2022). Moderate injury is, as defined by the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI), that resulted in suturing, application of steri-strips or skin glue, splinting, or muscle/joint strain (Ganey, 2020). NPSD findings also demonstrated that mild to moderate level of harm represent 24.2.%, 0.4% - severe harm, and 0.1% - death (NPSD, 2022; WHO, 2009). \n\nBy focusing on falls with major and moderate injuries, the goal of this hospital harm eCQM is to raise awareness of fall rates and, ultimately, to improve patient safety by preventing falls with injury in all hospital patients.
