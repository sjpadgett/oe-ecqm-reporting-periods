Although THA is an effective procedure for addressing osteoarthritis for many patients, some people, particularly those with more severe preoperative pain and impairment, do not experience the improvements in pain, function, and quality of life expected from the procedure (Beswick et al., 2012; Fortin et al., 1999; Tilbury et al., 2016). In 2010, providers performed 326,100 THAs, with 95 percent of them in patients age 45 and older (Wolford, Palso, \u0026 Bercovitz, 2015). Although THAs were introduced as a procedure for older adults, the percentage of patients age 55 to 64 (29 percent) who had a THA in 2010 exceeded the percentage of patients age 75 and older (26 percent) who had a THA (Wolford, Palso, \u0026 Bercovitz, 2015). Kurtz et al. (2009) projected that patients younger than 65 would account for 52 percent of THAs by 2030. This growth in hip surgeries for patients younger than 65 is significant because these patients often require more expensive joint arthroplasties that will better withstand the wear caused by physical activity (Bozic et al., 2006). This measure evaluates whether patients complete a patient-reported functional status assessment (FSA) before and after a THA. Measuring functional status for patients undergoing THA permits longitudinal assessment - from the patient's perspective - of the impact of surgical intervention on pain, physical function, as well as health-related quality of life (Rothrock et al., 2010).","name":"Rationale","code_obj":{"type":"CD","system":"2.16.840.1.113883.5.4","code":"RAT","title":"Rationale"},"value_obj":{"type":"ED","value":"THAs are common surgical procedures that address hip pain and functional impairment, primarily caused by osteoarthritis.

Peer-reviewed and grey literature support additional exclusions for patients undergoing total hip replacements. Staged procedures, concurrent procedures, partial procedures, resurfacing procedures, revision procedures, and removal of implant devices or prosthesis were linked to significant morbidity; complications (such as dislocation, infection, and reinfection); and high failure rates (Ludwick et al., 2021). In addition, mechanical complications, such as instability and dislocation, are also linked to complications and are associated with primary and revision THA/Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) (Gkiatas et al., 2021). Malignant neoplasms (such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head) are associated with substantial pain and functional disabilities before THA/TKA (Bernhard et al., 2021).

In particular, they recommend the Veterans RAND 12-item health survey (VR-12) or the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]-10-Global as the general health questionnaire and the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [HOOS], Jr. as the disease-specific questionnaire (American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the American Joint Replacement Registry, The Hip Society, The Knee Society, \u0026 the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, 2015). Peer-reviewed and grey literature support additional exclusions for patients undergoing total hip replacements. Staged procedures, concurrent procedures, partial procedures, resurfacing procedures, revision procedures, and removal of implant devices or prosthesis were linked to significant morbidity; complications (such as dislocation, infection, and reinfection); and high failure rates (Ludwick et al., 2021). In addition, mechanical complications, such as instability and dislocation, are also linked to complications and are associated with primary and revision THA/Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) (Gkiatas et al., 2021). Malignant neoplasms (such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head) are associated with substantial pain and functional disabilities before THA/TKA (Bernhard et al., 2021). Additionally, peer-reviewed and grey literature support various postoperative time frames, including follow-up within 10 to 14 months (Franklin et al., 2021) (Holte et al., 2021).","media_type":"text/plain"}},{"code":"IDUR","value":"Higher score indicates better quality","name":"Improvement Notation","code_obj":{"type":"CD","system":"2.16.840.1.113883.5.4","code":"IDUR","title":"Improvement Notation"},"value_obj":{"type":"ED","value":"Higher score indicates better quality","media_type":"text/plain"}},{"code":"REF","value":"CITATION American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, The American Joint Replacement Registry, The Hip Society, The Knee Society, \u0026 the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons.
