As a result, a new race-neutral eGFR equation that measures serum creatinine or cystatin C incorporates age, sex, and race to estimate measured GFR has been developed and is recommended by the Task Force from the National Kidney Foundation and American Society of Nephrology (Inker et al., 2021; Diao et al., 2021; Delgado et al., 2021; Delgado et al., 2022).

The numerator harm, AKI stage 2 or greater, is defined as an increase in serum creatinine at least 2 times higher than the lowest serum creatinine value. The increased value must be greater than the highest sex-specific normal value for serum creatinine. The following steps are performed to determine if these criteria for AKI are met: - To identify AKI stage 2 or greater, evaluate if any serum creatinine value obtained between 48 hours after the start of the hospitalization and either discharge or 30 days after the start of the hospitalization, whichever is sooner, is at least 1.5 times higher than the lowest value obtained within the prior 7 days. If yes, then: - Evaluate if the increased serum creatinine is greater than the highest sex-specific normal value for serum creatinine. If yes, then: - To stage AKI, evaluate if any serum creatinine value obtained between 48 hours after the start of the hospitalization and either discharge or 30 days after the start of the hospitalization, whichever is sooner, is at least 2 times higher than the lowest prior value (at any prior time) during that encounter. If yes, then: - Evaluate if the increased serum creatinine value is greater than the highest sex-specific normal value for serum creatinine. If yes, then an AKI stage 2 or greater has been identified. The highest normal serum creatinine value for females is defined as 1.02 mg/dL. The highest normal serum creatinine value for males is defined as 1.18 mg/dL. The eGFR values are calculated using the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation, recommended by the National Kidney Foundation (Delgado et al., 2022). This is a sex-specific, race-neutral formula. The CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation used for females: 142 x [min((Serum Creatinine)/0.7,1)] raised to the power of (-0.241) x max [((Serum Creatinine)/0.7,1) raised to the power of (-1.200)] x [0.9938] raised to the power of Age x 1.012. The CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation used for males: 142 x [min((Serum Creatinine)/0.9,1)] raised to the power of (-0.302) x max [((Serum Creatinine)/0.9,1) raised to the power of (-1.200)] x [0.9938] raised to the power of Age. The \"index\" serum creatinine is defined as the lowest serum creatinine value within the first 24 hours of encounter start. If there are no serum creatinine values within the first 24 hours, then the index is the first serum creatinine value within the first 48 hours of the encounter start. This serum creatinine value is used to identify and exclude patients with AKI at the start of the encounter. The \"index\" eGFR is calculated using the \"index\" serum creatinine, patient sex, and patient age based on the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation. \"Initiation\" of kidney dialysis (CRRT, hemodialysis, and peritoneal) during hospitalization is defined as documentation that kidney dialysis (CRRT, hemodialysis, or peritoneal) was started during the encounter. In addition to clinical electronic health record data, this measure uses Present on Admission (POA) indicators (e.g., POA = U) as found in billing/claims system within the measure criteria. The POA Indicator is intended to differentiate conditions present at the time of admission from those conditions that develop during the inpatient admission. - A POA Indicator of Y = yes (Diagnosis was present at time of inpatient admission) - A POA Indicator of N = no (Diagnosis was not present at time of inpatient admission) - A POA Indicator of W = clinically undetermined - A POA Indicator of U = documentation insufficient to determine if the condition was present at the time of inpatient admission Per CMS and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) convention, POA indicators of Y and W are accepted indicators of a diagnosis present on admission. POA indicators of N and U are accepted indicators of a diagnosis that is not present on admission.","name":"Definition","code_obj":{"type":"CD","system":"2.16.840.1.113883.5.4","code":"DEF","title":"Definition"},"value_obj":{"type":"ED","value":"Inpatient hospitalizations: Includes time in the emergency department and observation when the transition between these encounters (if they exist) and the inpatient encounter are within an hour or less of each other.
