It is estimated that about 20-40 percent of the adult population has hypertension; the majority of people over age 65 have a hypertension diagnosis (Appleton et al., 2013 and Luehr et al., 2012). Winter (2013) noted that 1 in 3 American adults have hypertension and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension is 90 percent. The African American population or non-Hispanic Blacks, the elderly, diabetics and those with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and renal disease. Non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest prevalence at 38.6 percent (Winter et al., 2013). Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, stroke and dementia (Luehr et al., 2012). Prevention of hypertension and the treatment of established hypertension are complementary approaches to reducing cardiovascular disease risk in the population, but prevention of hypertension provides the optimal means of reducing risk and avoiding harmful consequences. Periodic blood pressure (BP) screening can identify individuals who develop elevated BP over time. More frequent BP screening may be particularly important for individuals with elevated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (Whelton et al., 2018). Hypertension is the most common reason for adult office visits other than pregnancy. Garrison (2013) stated that in 2007, 42 million ambulatory visits were attributed to hypertension (Garrison \u0026 Oberhelman, 2013). It also has the highest utilization of prescription drugs. Numerous resources and treatment options are available, yet only about 40-50 percent of the hypertensive patients have their blood pressure under control (\u003c140/90) (Appleton et al., 2013 and Luehr et al., 2012). In addition to medication non-compliance, poor outcomes are also attributed to poor adherence to lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, weight loss, increased exercise and limiting alcohol intake. Many adults find it difficult to continue medications and lifestyle changes when they are asymptomatic. Symptoms of elevated blood pressure usually do not occur until secondary problems arise such as with vascular diseases (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and renal insufficiency) (Luehr et al., 2012). Appropriate follow-up after blood pressure measurement is a pivotal component in preventing the progression of hypertension and the development of heart disease. Detection of marginally or fully elevated blood pressure by a specialty clinician warrants referral to a provider familiar with the management of hypertension and prehypertension. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017 Guidelines provide updated recommendations for ASCVD risk. For additional information please refer to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines: https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2017/11/09/11/41/2017-guideline-for-high-blood-pressure-in-adults. Lifestyle modifications have demonstrated effectiveness in lowering blood pressure (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003). The synergistic effect of several lifestyle modifications results in greater benefits than a single modification alone. Baseline diagnostic/laboratory testing establishes if a co-existing underlying condition is the etiology of hypertension and evaluates if end organ damage from hypertension has already occurred. Landmark trials such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) have repeatedly proven the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy to control blood pressure and reduce the complications of hypertension. A review of 35 studies found that the pharmacist-led interventions involved medication counseling and patient education. Twenty-nine of the 35 studies showed statistically significant improvement in BP levels of the intervention groups at follow-up (Reeves et al., 2020). Follow-up intervals based on blood pressure control have been established by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Whelton et al., 2018; USPSTF, 2021).","name":"Rationale","code_obj":{"type":"CD","system":"2.16.840.1.113883.5.4","code":"RAT","title":"Rationale"},"value_obj":{"type":"ED","value":"Hypertension is a prevalent condition that affects approximately 66.9 million people in the United States.

A review of 35 studies found that the pharmacist-led interventions involved medication counseling and patient education. Twenty-nine of the 35 studies showed statistically significant improvement in BP levels of the intervention groups at follow-up (Reeves et al., 2020). Follow-up intervals based on blood pressure control have been established by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Whelton et al., 2018; USPSTF, 2021).","media_type":"text/plain"}},{"code":"CRS","value":"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2021) recommends screening for high blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older.
