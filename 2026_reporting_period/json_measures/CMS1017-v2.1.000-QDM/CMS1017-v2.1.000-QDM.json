The number of days will be counted as whole numbers; any fractional periods are dropped. For example, an eligible encounter with a length of stay of 75 hours will be measured as 3 days (72 hours). This measure includes two measure observations used to calculate the ratio of the number of encounters with a fall over the total number of eligible hospital days. The ratio is reported as the rate of inpatient hospitalizations with falls with moderate or major injury per 1000 patient days. To express the rate of inpatient hospitalizations with falls with moderate or major injury per 1,000 patient days, the following calculation is applied post-production during implementation: (Total number of encounters with falls with moderate or major injury / Total number of eligible hospital days) x 1000 = rate. Example: 1 eligible encounter with a patient fall with moderate or major injury over 120 eligible days (1/120) x 1000 = 8.33. In ratio measures, both the Denominator and Numerator populations flow separately from the same Initial Population. Therefore, the same exclusion criteria must be applied to both the Denominator and Numerator to prevent excluded cases from being considered. This eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period. This version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.6.
