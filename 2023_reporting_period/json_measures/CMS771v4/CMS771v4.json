The enlarged gland had been proposed to contribute to the overall lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) complex (McVary et al., 2014). Although LUTS secondary to BPH is not often a life-threatening condition, the impact of LUTS/BPH on quality of life can be significant (Wei, Calhoun, \u0026 Jacobsen, 2005). The American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were developed to measure outcomes in studies of different treatments for BPH (Wuerstle et al., 2011).

It includes 3 storage symptom questions (frequency, nocturia, urgency) and four voiding symptoms (feeling of incomplete emptying, intermittency, straining, and a weak stream) as well as a Bother question: If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that?
